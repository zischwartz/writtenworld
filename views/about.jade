          p Default color was silly. Switched to randomly assigning colors, and let people change it from there.

          p Changed the default color of text to light blue instead of gray. Fixed the bug-while-writing fast, mostly, though zoomed out it's still a problem. 
          p Implemented error message and auto-refresh when there's a connection hiccup. Previously it had just hung, and not allow you to type.

          h4 You put me in the wrong place. Why?
          p HTML5 geolocation is an experimental feature. It doesn't work perfectly. Try restarting your browser. 

          h4 Why can't I write sometimes? And what's all this "echo" business?
          p The idea behind echos and when you can or can't write is based on the now ubiquitous idea of upvoting and downvoting content.
          p In short, echoes are analogous to upvotes, and overwriting is analogous to downvotes. You can't echo a character you've written or already echoed, and you can't overwrite a character you've already overwritten.
